Studio Ghibli Style Prompt for 03-TheEmpress.png:

Create a highly detailed, portrait-oriented tarot card image in the style of Studio Ghibli, featuring the Empress as a gentle, nurturing figure symbolizing fertility, motherhood, nature, and abundance. The composition centers the Empress seated on a throne, surrounded by a dreamy, lush forest background that integrates seamlessly with her form, emphasizing harmony with nature. Her appearance is whimsical and soft, with flowing hair adorned with small flowers and leaves, large expressive eyes conveying a knowing and benevolent gaze, and a serene expression. She wears a flowing robe with a luminescent pomegranate pattern that appears alive and gently floating, symbolizing life, death, and rebirth. In her hand, she holds a scepter transformed into a staff topped with a blooming flower, representing growth and authority. At her side, a shield manifests as a soft, glowing orb etched with the Venus symbol, surrounded by a delicate aura to evoke love, beauty, and femininity. Her crown features 12 softly glowing stars, delicate and adorned with fluttering leaves and flowers, signifying completeness and cosmic order.

The throne is made of intertwining vines and flowers that seem to grow naturally, with plush moss cushions in earthy reds for passion and vitality. The background depicts a vibrant yet ethereal forest with exaggerated, whimsical trees whose leaves dance in a gentle breeze, a sparkling waterfall cascading like liquid light, and playful spirits or glowing fireflies adding a magical, interactive element to the scene. Small, whimsical creatures flit about, enhancing the mystical themes of creation, nurturing, and the cyclical nature of life.

Use soft pastel colors throughout, including gentle greens, blues, pinks, and golds, with subtle gradients and less saturation for a dreamy, ethereal quality. Apply soft, watercolor-like textures with organic, flowing lines to capture Studio Ghibli's aesthetic of gentle lighting and whimsical details; the overall scene is bathed in a magical glow emanating from the Empress, creating a warm, inviting atmosphere.

At the top of the card, include the text "III" in a whimsical, hand-drawn font colored in soft gold, centered and slightly smaller. At the bottom, add "THE EMPRESS" in a flowing, script-like font, also in soft gold and slightly larger, with a gentle glow that integrates seamlessly into the mystical vibe. Ensure the entire image is in portrait orientation, suitable for a standard tarot card, with a balanced composition that draws the eye to the central figure while blending nature elements fluidly.
