Studio Ghibli Style Prompt for 02-TheHighPriestess.png:

Create a highly detailed, portrait-oriented tarot card image in the style of Studio Ghibli, featuring soft watercolor-like textures, gentle lighting, whimsical characters, and a dreamy, nature-inspired atmosphere with organic flowing lines. The scene depicts The High Priestess as the central figure, embodying intuition, mystery, and inner wisdom, with a serene and youthful appearance: she has large, expressive eyes, a gentle smile, and is dressed in a soft sky-blue robe adorned with subtle floral patterns that blend seamlessly into the surrounding environment. She sits or stands gracefully in the center, holding an ancient, slightly glowing parchment scroll with golden edges and small, luminous runes symbolizing hidden knowledge.

Frame her with two ancient stone pillars: the left pillar, carved with a flowing 'B' for Boaz, is dark and covered in lush green moss and twisting vines; the right pillar, carved with a 'J' for Jachin, is lighter with hints of white stone and similar natural growth, representing balance and duality. At her feet lies a soft, glowing crescent moon, casting a gentle ethereal light that reflects off her robe. Surrounding the scene, delicate pomegranates are reimagined as glowing orbs hanging from natural vines, emitting a soft luminescence and symbolizing fertility and divine mysteries. Her headpiece is a delicate horned crown with stylized, flowing shapes and embedded glowing gems, evoking spiritual authority.

The background is a lush, dreamlike forest or enchanted garden, with soft light filtering through leaves, fireflies and small glowing creatures adding a magical, whimsical touch. Use a palette of soft pastel colors: light blues and greens for the robe and nature elements, earthy tones with mossy greens for the pillars, and glowing golds for accents like the scroll and gems. The overall lighting is gentle and diffused, creating a mystical, serene atmosphere that emphasizes themes of spiritual insight and the balance between opposites.

Incorporate text elements: at the top, center the Roman numeral "II" in a small, whimsical, hand-drawn font in glowing gold; at the bottom, center "THE HIGH PRIESTESS" in a larger, flowing ornate script in glowing gold, with "HIGH" slightly emphasized and subtle organic flourishes that integrate with the scene.

Ensure the image is in portrait orientation, with a standard tarot card aspect ratio (approximately 2:3), high detail in textures like flowing vines and soft watercolor blends, and an overall enchanting, timeless quality characteristic of Studio Ghibli artistry.
