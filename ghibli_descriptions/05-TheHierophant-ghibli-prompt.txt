Studio Ghibli Style Prompt for 05-TheHierophant.png:

Create a highly detailed, portrait-oriented tarot card image in the style of Studio Ghibli, featuring a reimagined version of The Hierophant that blends mystical symbolism with whimsical, nature-inspired aesthetics. The scene centers on a gentle, wise Hierophant figure, depicted as a kind elderly man with soft, flowing robes that billow gently in a breeze, his face serene with a subtle smile and closed eyes in meditation, symbolizing spiritual authority and guidance. He wears a delicate floral crown made of intertwined leaves and small blooming flowers, glowing softly with a luminescent gold hue to represent divine connection; in his hand, he holds a scepter topped with a cross, wrapped in verdant vines and adorned with tiny glowing orbs at the ends, blending earthly and divine realms. At his feet lie two intricately designed keys—one pointing upwards towards the sky, the other downwards into the earth—carved with organic patterns like leaves and vines, symbolizing the mysteries of knowledge and the bridge between realms.

Flanking the Hierophant are two young followers, one male and one female, dressed in simple, natural garments that appear woven from forest materials, seated on a mossy stone bench with expressions of wonder and respect, emphasizing themes of teaching, learning, and the transmission of wisdom. The composition is softly symmetrical, with the Hierophant dominating the center, surrounded by a dreamy forest temple background where ancient columns are overgrown with ivy and flowers, and gentle sunlight filters through a canopy of leaves, casting dappled, ethereal light that creates a soft, watercolor-like texture with organic flowing lines.

Use a palette of soft pastels: the Hierophant's outer robe in a muted, gradient red fading to lighter shades for vitality and harmony; his inner garment in creamy white with subtle shading for purity and depth; the crown and scepter in glowing gold tones; and the background in gentle hues of greens, blues, and pinks to evoke a whimsical, nurturing atmosphere. The overall image should have a dreamy, hand-drawn quality with soft edges, fluid animations, and a focus on nature elements like grass, flowers, and light rays, capturing Studio Ghibli's essence of enchantment and serenity.

At the top, include the Roman numeral 'V' in a soft, golden, glowing font, centered and proportionate to the card's width; at the bottom, center the text 'THE HIEROPHANT' in a whimsical, hand-drawn style font with subtle integrations of vines and leaves, in a soft blue or green, fitting the portrait orientation for a standard tarot card size. Ensure the entire image is rendered in high detail with gentle lighting, organic textures, and a harmonious, mystical whimsy.
