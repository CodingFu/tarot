### Reimagined in Studio Ghibli Style

**Visual Details:**
- **Background**: A soft, pastel sky with gentle gradients from light blue to a creamy peach near the horizon. The mountain in the background is less stark, more rounded and covered with lush greenery, suggesting a harmonious coexistence with nature.
- **The Sun**: Rendered in a softer yellow, with rays that are more rounded and less sharp, giving a gentle, nurturing glow. The sun might have a face, typical of Ghibli's anthropomorphic elements, with a friendly, smiling expression.
- **The Angel**: The angel would be depicted with softer, more whimsical features. Instead of a stern figure, it would have a gentle, almost childlike face with large, expressive eyes. The wings would be more feathery and less rigid, with shades of soft pink and white. The robe would be flowing, made of light, translucent fabric with delicate patterns of flowers or leaves.
- **The Couple**: The man and woman would have a more youthful, almost anime-like appearance with large, expressive eyes. Their expressions would be serene and loving. Their bodies would be more stylized, with gentle curves and less anatomical detail, emphasizing innocence and purity. The woman's hair might have flowers woven into it, and the man's hair might be tousled by a gentle breeze.
- **The Tree**: The tree would be lush and vibrant, with large, detailed leaves and fruits that look almost magical, glowing slightly with an inner light. Vines might gently wrap around the tree, adding to the organic feel.
- **The Serpent**: If included, the serpent would be more like a friendly, wise creature, perhaps with a soft, glowing aura, symbolizing knowledge in a positive light.

**Text:**
- **Top Text**: "VII" in a whimsical, hand-drawn font, colored in a soft gold, centered at the top of the card.
- **Bottom Text**: "THE LOVERS" in a flowing, script-like font, also in soft gold, centered at the bottom. The font would have gentle curves and slight flourishes, maintaining the Ghibli aesthetic of elegance and whimsy.

**Overall Aesthetic:**
- The entire card would have a dreamy, almost ethereal quality, with soft focus edges and a sense of movement in the lines, as if everything is gently swaying in a breeze. The colors would be pastel and harmonious, creating a soothing and inviting atmosphere. The composition would retain the symmetry but with a more organic flow, where elements blend into each other seamlessly, reflecting Ghibli's love for nature and gentle storytelling.

=== STUDIO GHIBLI STYLE PROMPT ===
Create a highly detailed, portrait-oriented tarot card image in the style of Studio Ghibli, capturing the essence of the original Lovers card with its symbolic elements and mystical themes of love, partnership, choices, divine guidance, duality, unity, temptation, and knowledge. The composition should be vertically divided into three sections: the divine at the top, the human in the middle, and the earthly at the bottom, with a symmetrical layout featuring an angel centrally above a couple, forming a gentle triangle of influence. The overall aesthetic should feature soft, watercolor-like textures, gentle lighting with a dreamy, ethereal glow, organic flowing lines, whimsical characters, and a harmonious blend of nature elements, evoking a soothing, inviting atmosphere as if everything is swaying softly in a breeze.

In the background, depict a soft pastel sky with gentle gradients from light blue at the top to a creamy peach near the horizon, with a rounded mountain covered in lush, vibrant greenery symbolizing challenges and spiritual journeys. At the top, render the Sun as a soft yellow orb with rounded rays and a friendly, smiling face, radiating a nurturing glow to symbolize enlightenment and vitality.

In the middle section, portray the Angel as a whimsical, childlike figure with large, expressive eyes, soft pink and white feathery wings, and a flowing robe made of translucent fabric adorned with delicate patterns of flowers and leaves, representing divine guidance and protection. Below the Angel, show the Couple as youthful, anime-inspired figures with serene, loving expressions, large expressive eyes, gentle curves, and stylized bodies emphasizing innocence; the woman on the left with flowers woven into her hair and the man on the right with tousled hair blowing in a gentle breeze, symbolizing human love and the duality of masculine and feminine energies.

On the left side, illustrate the Tree as a lush, vibrant entity with large, detailed leaves, glowing magical fruits, and gently wrapping vines, representing the Tree of Knowledge and temptation with a positive, enlightening aura. If included, subtly add a friendly Serpent as a wise, glowing creature coiled near the tree, symbolizing knowledge in a harmonious light.

Use a pastel color palette with harmonious tones: bright yet soft yellow for the Sun, muted reds for the mountain and angel's accents, earthy greens and browns for the tree and foliage, natural skin tones for the figures, and a serene blue-to-peach sky gradient. Incorporate soft focus edges, gentle lighting that casts a warm, diffused glow, and organic, flowing lines that blend elements seamlessly.

At the top, center the text "VII" in a whimsical, hand-drawn font colored in soft gold. At the bottom, center "THE LOVERS" in a flowing, script-like font with gentle curves and flourishes, also in soft gold. Ensure the entire image is in portrait orientation, suitable for a tarot card, with a dreamy Ghibli-inspired atmosphere that feels magical, nature-infused, and full of wonder.
