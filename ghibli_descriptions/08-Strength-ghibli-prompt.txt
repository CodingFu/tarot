Studio Ghibli Style Prompt for 08-Strength.png:

Create a highly detailed, portrait-oriented image in the style of Studio Ghibli, depicting a reimagined tarot card for "Strength." The scene embodies themes of inner strength, gentleness, courage, and harmonious balance between human spirit and primal instincts, with soft watercolor-like textures, gentle lighting, whimsical characters, and organic flowing lines that evoke a dreamy, nature-inspired atmosphere.

At the center, slightly off-center to the left for dynamic flow, stands a young, ethereal woman with large, expressive eyes, a serene and compassionate smile, and soft, flowing hair adorned with delicate flowers. She wears a light cream dress that billows gently in a soft breeze, featuring subtle floral patterns that blend seamlessly with the environment, symbolizing purity and nurturing strength. She gently touches the head of a majestic lion beside her, which has a warm, gentle orange coat with hints of soft pink and a mane that resembles fluffy clouds, conveying kindness and trust rather than intimidation. The lion leans into her touch affectionately, emphasizing mutual respect and the balance of raw power with compassion.

Above the woman's head, a glowing infinity symbol (lemniscate) in soft blue or lavender pulsates gently with a magical aura, representing eternal energy and spiritual infinity. The background features a lush, enchanted forest with soft pastel yellow hues transitioning to gentle greens and blues at the edges, creating a dreamy atmosphere. Sunlight filters softly through the canopy, casting warm, diffused glows and subtle shadows, while leaves, petals, and tiny glowing insects or spirits float whimsically in the air, adding movement and magic. Vines and vibrant flowers wrap around the woman and lion, symbolizing growth, renewal, and connection to nature.

The overall composition is portrait-oriented, with the figures occupying the main focal area and the environment providing a flowing, immersive backdrop. Use soft, organic lines and watercolor textures for a hand-drawn, ethereal quality typical of Studio Ghibli, with gentle lighting that highlights the interplay of harmony and wonder.

At the top, center the text "VIII" in a whimsical, hand-drawn style, in soft blue or pastel color, with a slight curve to mimic the scene's flow. At the bottom, center "STRENGTH" in a playful, rounded font, slightly larger, in gentle green or light brown, adorned with small floral decorations to tie into the nature theme.

Ensure the image maintains a balanced, enchanting aesthetic, suitable for a tarot card, with high detail in textures, colors, and lighting to capture Studio Ghibli's essence of magic and emotional depth.
