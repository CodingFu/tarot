### Reimagining in Studio Ghibli Style

**Symbolic Elements:**
- Maintain the woman and lion, but with a softer, more whimsical appearance.
- The infinity symbol remains above the woman's head, now glowing softly with a magical aura.

**Composition:**
- The scene would be more dynamic with a gentle, flowing background, perhaps with a soft breeze animating the scene. The woman and lion would be slightly off-center, with more interaction with the environment, like leaves and petals floating around them.

**Colors:**
- **Background:** A soft pastel yellow, transitioning into gentle greens and blues at the edges, giving a dreamy atmosphere.
- **Lion:** A warm, gentle orange with hints of soft pink, giving it a more friendly and less intimidating look.
- **Woman's Dress:** A flowing, light cream or off-white dress with subtle floral patterns, made of a fabric that looks like it's moving with the wind.
- **Green Elements:** Enhanced with more detailed, lush greenery, with vines and flowers gently wrapping around the woman, almost like they're alive.

**Mystical Themes:**
- The themes remain, but with a Ghibli touch of magic and wonder. The interaction between the woman and lion would feel more like a dance or a gentle conversation, emphasizing harmony and mutual respect.

**Visual Details for Image Generation:**
- **Woman:** A young, ethereal woman with soft, flowing hair adorned with delicate flowers. Her expression is serene and compassionate, with a gentle smile. Her eyes are large and expressive, typical of Ghibli characters.
- **Lion:** A majestic yet gentle lion with a mane that looks like it's made of soft, fluffy clouds. Its eyes are kind, and it leans into the woman's touch with a sense of trust and affection.
- **Environment:** A lush, enchanted forest with soft light filtering through the canopy. Tiny, glowing insects or spirits might float around, adding to the magical ambiance.
- **Infinity Symbol:** A glowing, soft blue or lavender lemniscate, pulsating gently, adding a mystical touch to the scene.

**Text:**
- **Top Text:** "VIII" in a whimsical, hand-drawn style, in a soft blue or pastel color, centered at the top with a slight curve to mimic the flow of the scene.
- **Bottom Text:** "STRENGTH." in a playful, rounded font, slightly larger, in a gentle green or light brown, centered at the bottom, with small floral decorations around the letters to tie into the nature theme.

=== STUDIO GHIBLI STYLE PROMPT ===
Create a highly detailed, portrait-oriented image in the style of Studio Ghibli, depicting a reimagined tarot card for "Strength." The scene embodies themes of inner strength, gentleness, courage, and harmonious balance between human spirit and primal instincts, with soft watercolor-like textures, gentle lighting, whimsical characters, and organic flowing lines that evoke a dreamy, nature-inspired atmosphere.

At the center, slightly off-center to the left for dynamic flow, stands a young, ethereal woman with large, expressive eyes, a serene and compassionate smile, and soft, flowing hair adorned with delicate flowers. She wears a light cream dress that billows gently in a soft breeze, featuring subtle floral patterns that blend seamlessly with the environment, symbolizing purity and nurturing strength. She gently touches the head of a majestic lion beside her, which has a warm, gentle orange coat with hints of soft pink and a mane that resembles fluffy clouds, conveying kindness and trust rather than intimidation. The lion leans into her touch affectionately, emphasizing mutual respect and the balance of raw power with compassion.

Above the woman's head, a glowing infinity symbol (lemniscate) in soft blue or lavender pulsates gently with a magical aura, representing eternal energy and spiritual infinity. The background features a lush, enchanted forest with soft pastel yellow hues transitioning to gentle greens and blues at the edges, creating a dreamy atmosphere. Sunlight filters softly through the canopy, casting warm, diffused glows and subtle shadows, while leaves, petals, and tiny glowing insects or spirits float whimsically in the air, adding movement and magic. Vines and vibrant flowers wrap around the woman and lion, symbolizing growth, renewal, and connection to nature.

The overall composition is portrait-oriented, with the figures occupying the main focal area and the environment providing a flowing, immersive backdrop. Use soft, organic lines and watercolor textures for a hand-drawn, ethereal quality typical of Studio Ghibli, with gentle lighting that highlights the interplay of harmony and wonder.

At the top, center the text "VIII" in a whimsical, hand-drawn style, in soft blue or pastel color, with a slight curve to mimic the scene's flow. At the bottom, center "STRENGTH" in a playful, rounded font, slightly larger, in gentle green or light brown, adorned with small floral decorations to tie into the nature theme.
