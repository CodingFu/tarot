**Colors:**
- **Background:** A soft pastel yellow, transitioning into gentle greens and blues at the edges, giving a dreamy atmosphere.
- **Lion:** A warm, gentle orange with hints of soft pink, giving it a more friendly and less intimidating look.
- **Woman's Dress:** A flowing, light cream or off-white dress with subtle floral patterns, made of a fabric that looks like it's moving with the wind.
- **Green Elements:** Enhanced with more detailed, lush greenery, with vines and flowers gently wrapping around the woman, almost like they're alive.

**Mystical Themes:**
- The themes remain, but with a Ghibli touch of magic and wonder. The interaction between the woman and lion would feel more like a dance or a gentle conversation, emphasizing harmony and mutual respect.

- **Lion:** A majestic yet gentle lion with a mane that looks like it's made of soft, fluffy clouds. Its eyes are kind, and it leans into the woman's touch with a sense of trust and affection.
- **Environment:** A lush, enchanted forest with soft light filtering through the canopy. Tiny, glowing insects or spirits might float around, adding to the magical ambiance.
- **Infinity Symbol:** A glowing, soft blue or lavender lemniscate, pulsating gently, adding a mystical touch to the scene.

**Text:**
- **Top Text:** "VIII" in a whimsical, hand-drawn style, in a soft blue or pastel color, centered at the top with a slight curve to mimic the flow of the scene.
- **Bottom Text:** "STRENGTH." in a playful, rounded font, slightly larger, in a gentle green or light brown, centered at the bottom, with small floral decorations around the letters to tie into the nature theme.
