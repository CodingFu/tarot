Studio Ghibli Style Prompt for 07-TheChariot.png:

Create a vertical portrait-oriented image in the style of Studio Ghibli, depicting a reimagined Tarot card "The Chariot" with soft watercolor-like textures, gentle ethereal lighting, and a dreamy, whimsical atmosphere that emphasizes harmony with nature, balance of dualities, and a peaceful spiritual journey. The composition is vertically divided into three organic, flowing sections: the upper section features a soft pastel sky gradient transitioning from dawn pink to dusk yellow, evoking celestial guidance; the middle section centers on a gentle, youthful charioteer as the focal point; and the lower section shows two symmetrical, fantastical sphinxes in relaxed, natural poses, interacting with their environment for balance.

At the center, the charioteer is a serene young adventurer with flowing garments made of leaves, petals, and soft fabrics, standing tall with a peaceful expression, wearing a star crown of glowing ethereal flowers that emit a subtle, warm light for divine inspiration. The chariot is a whimsical, nature-inspired vehicle crafted from aged wood, adorned with intertwining vines, blooming flowers, and subtle magical runes, symbolizing movement and progress while blending seamlessly with the surroundings.

In the lower section, the two sphinxes are reimagined as friendly, fantastical creatures resembling a mix of forest deer and foxes with soft, rounded sphinx-like features—one in gentle white tones representing light and positivity, the other in subtle black shades for darkness and challenges—positioned symmetrically and pulling the chariot in harmony, emphasizing duality without conflict.

The background includes a dreamy forest cityscape with lush greenery, rounded organic architecture, floating lanterns, and fireflies, suggesting a journey between nature and civilization. A wooden shield on the chariot features delicate butterfly wings and a glowing red heart symbol at its center, representing protection, swiftness, and spiritual ascension.

Use a soft pastel color palette dominated by gentle greens, blues, pinks, and yellows, with watercolor-blended textures for an organic, hand-drawn feel and soft, diffused lighting that creates a magical glow. At the top, include the text "VII" in a whimsical, hand-drawn font in soft blue with a faint glow. At the bottom, add "THE CHARIOT" in a larger whimsical font in gentle green, centered and decorated with small vine and floral motifs to integrate with the nature theme. Ensure the overall image has flowing lines, whimsical characters, and a serene, enchanting Studio Ghibli aesthetic, capturing the card's themes of victory, willpower, and balance in a nurturing, nature-centric manner.
